# DFAMiner
A python tool for mining a minimal DFA from a given set of labelled samples.

For details of the algorithm, please read paper [[1]](#1):



## Requirements

                   [--solver {glucose4,glucose42,minisat22,cadical103,cadical153,lingeling,maplechrono,gluecard4,cadical195,mergesat3}] [--lower LOWER] [--upper UPPER] [--3dfa] [--nobfs]
                   [--safety] [--verify]

Mining a minimal DFA consistent with samples

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --file path           path to input sample file
  --out path            path to output DFA
  --output-format {dot,textual}
                        the format for the output
  --intermediate path   path to output the intermediate 3DFA
  --solver {glucose4,glucose42,minisat22,cadical103,cadical153,lingeling,maplechrono,gluecard4,cadical195,mergesat3}
                        choose the SAT solver
  --lower LOWER         the lower bound for the DFA
  --upper UPPER         the upper bound for the DFA
  --3dfa                use three valued DFA for inference
  --nobfs               disable the constraints for BFS tree
  --safety              construct safety DFA for solving parity games
  --verify              verify resultant DFA
```

#### SAT solvers
 
For more SAT solvers, see [PySAT toolkit](https://github.com/pysathq/pysat).

#### Input format

dfaminer.py accepts a file in [Abbadingo format](https://abbadingo.cs.nuim.ie/).
An example file is given below:
```
8 2
1 3 0 0 0
1 3 0 0 1
0 3 0 1 0
0 3 0 1 1
1 3 1 0 0
0 3 1 0 1
0 3 1 1 0
0 3 1 1 1
```
The first line gives the number of samples and the size of the alphabet.
Each line after that will first specify the membership of the word, the length of the word and the word sequence.
Here `1` means accept, `0` reject and `-1` don't care.

It also accepts an equivalent JSON file as follows:
```
{ 
  "alphabet": ["0", "1"], 
  "accepting": ["000", "001", "100"], 
  "rejecting": ["010", "011", "101", "110", "111"]
}
```

#### Minimiser
One can also use minimiser.py as a standalone tool to minimise DFAs with don't care words.
An example input file is `intermediate_3dfa.txt`:
```
8 2
i 0
t 0 0 2
t 0 1 6
t 2 0 3
t 2 1 4
t 3 0 1
t 3 1 1
t 4 0 5
t 4 1 5
t 6 0 7
t 6 1 4
t 7 0 1
t 7 1 5
a 1
r 5
```


The format is quite straight-forward. 
The first line gives the number of states and the size of the alphabet.
For each line, `i` is followed by an initial state, `a` by a final state, `r` by a reject state, and `t` by a transition (source, letter, destination)
